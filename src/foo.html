<div>
    <p>This uses a hardcoded string, so it sets the value initially, but it won't have two way binding. It's mostly here for debugging.</p>
    <input id="optionA" type="text" value="Hello World!">
</div>

<div>
    <p>This one sets the value in the browser, but in tests it returns empty string?</p>
    <input id="optionB" type="text" value.bind="value">
</div>

<div>
    <p>This one doesn't get the value bound in the browser (?) and doesn't get set in tests.</p>
    <input id="optionC" type="text" value.bind>
</div>

<div>
    <p>This use string interpolation, so it won't have two way binding. The tests pass because it sets the value initially though. It's mostly here for debugging.</p>
    <input id="optionD" type="text" value="${value}">
</div>
